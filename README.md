# pydmdz

A Python 3 toolkit for [Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_mode_decomposition). DMD is a dimensionality reduction algorithm for extracting dynamical features from data and forecasting the future state of a dynamical system. This package is my custom build of DMD, including enhancements on exact DMD as well as advanced techniques such as [Optimal DMD (optDMD)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.02343v1). 

The package is in alpha. Your mileage may vary. Stay tuned for updates.
