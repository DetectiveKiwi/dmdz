# pydmdz

pydmdz is a Python 3 toolkit for [Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_mode_decomposition). DMD is a dimensionality reduction algorithm for extracting dynamical features from data and forecasting the future state of a dynamical system. 

This package is my custom build of DMD, including enhancements on exact DMD, advanced techniques such as [Optimal DMD (optDMD)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.02343v1), and built-in plotting tools with SVG out options.

The package is in alpha. Your mileage may vary. Stay tuned for updates.
